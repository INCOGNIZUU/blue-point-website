                    Blue Point Glasses are blue light glasses, also known as
                    computer glasses or screen glasses. You’ve probably heard of
                    them, right? These lightweight glasses are becoming
                    increasingly popular among the youth and digital generation.
                    After all, we spend many hours working or relaxing in front
                    of our digital devices.

                    HOW BLUE LIGHT <br />
                    AFFECTS YOUR EYES
                </h2>

                <p>
                    In large amounts, high-energy light from the sun - like
                    ultraviolet rays and blue light - can significantly increase
                    your risk of developing eye disease - that’s why traditional
                    sunglasses were invented. In our current climate and digital
                    age, the majority of people spend, on average, 9 hours every
                    single day in front of smartphones, computers, tablets,
                    televisions, and so on! Undoubtedly an important part of our
                    day in which our eyes are continuously working hard without
                    any type of protection. That’s raised concerns about the
                    harm that continuous exposure to blue light can have on our
                    windows to the world (the eyes of course). Experts think
                    digital eye strain, or computer vision syndrome, affects
                    about 50% of computer users, and symptoms of this could be
                    blurry vision, eyestrain, dry eyes, burning eyes, macular
                    degeneration, and cataracts. Some people have sleep issues
                    and headaches - sound familiar?

                                    off all devices at least two hours before
